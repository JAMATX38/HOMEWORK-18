* As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.



## Business Context



A consumer will reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Known Issues</span>**


Was able to get the   APP deployed and fix the bugs that were causing it to not work yesterday! 
I had to look up the aggrigate functions and insert those into my syntax.
The APP does not seem to be working fully on Heroku so I am also going to insert a video to show the app working after being deployed.
